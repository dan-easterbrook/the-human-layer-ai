      <h1>AI Adoption FAQ</h1>

      <p>
        This page is a practical index of common questions people ask when trying to adopt AI inside real organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each answer is intentionally short.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where it helps, there is a link to a deeper article that expands the point without adding noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Start Here</h2>

      <h3>What does AI adoption mean in practice?</h3>
      <p>
        AI adoption is not tool rollout. It is when workflows change, decision-making incorporates AI outputs, and outcomes improve reliably over time.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3>Where should a business start with AI?</h3>
      <p>
        Start with a small set of repeatable workflows, clear success measures, and a safe operating approach. Avoid starting with a platform decision before you have priority use cases.

      </p>

      <h2>Strategy and Operating Model</h2>

      <h3>How is an AI adoption strategy different from a list of use cases?</h3>
      <p>
        A strategy defines sequencing, ownership, capability investment, governance, and measurement. A list of use cases is an input, not a plan.

      </p>

      <h3>What should be measured to understand AI adoption progress?</h3>
      <p>
        Measure workflow adoption, cycle time reduction, quality and error rates, risk events, and operational load. Usage metrics alone rarely reflect business impact.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>Governance and Risk</h2>

      <h3>What is AI governance and why does it matter?</h3>
      <p>
        AI governance is the ownership model, risk controls, oversight and decision rights that allow AI to scale responsibly. Without it, progress often stalls after early pilots.

      <h3>What is responsible AI implementation in a business context?</h3>
      <p>
        Responsible implementation means clear ownership, risk assessment, appropriate controls, human review where needed, monitoring after deployment and capability building across teams.

      <h2>Transformation, Production and Reality Checks</h2>

      <h3>Is AI transformation the same as using AI tools?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Using AI tools can improve tasks inside existing workflows. AI transformation redesigns workflows, operating models and governance so AI becomes part of how the business runs.

      </p>

      <h3>Why do AI proof of concepts fail to reach production?</h3>
      <p>
        Because production requires data foundations, monitoring, ownership, change management and ongoing operational support. A proof of concept only demonstrates possibility.

      </p>

      <h3>How can leaders evaluate vendor claims about AI?</h3>
      <p>
        Ask how the tool fits into real workflows, what risks are introduced, what must change internally, and what outcomes are measurable. Be cautious of demos that avoid operational details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read more in <a href="/articles/vendor-reality-checks.html">Vendor Reality Checks</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the quickest way to lose trust during AI rollout?</h3>
      <p>
        Overpromising, shipping into unstable processes, and treating governance as a late-stage add-on. Trust is built through clarity, boundaries and consistent decision-making.
