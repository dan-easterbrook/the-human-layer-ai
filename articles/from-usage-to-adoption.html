      <h1>From Usage to Adoption</h1>
      <div class="meta">7–8 min read • Adoption</div>

      <p>Organisations often mistake activity for progress when it comes to data and AI.</p>
      <p>Tools are launched. Dashboards are refreshed. Pilots are announced.</p>
      <p>Momentum appears visible.</p>
      <p>Yet eighteen months later, a new leader arrives and the cycle begins again.</p>
      <p>The issue is rarely capability. It is confusion between usage and adoption.</p>
      <p>Usage is the act of turning something on.<br>
      Adoption is the act of changing how work is done.</p>
      <p>The first can happen in a week.<br>
      The second requires sponsorship, patience and organisational design.</p>
      <p>Until that distinction is understood, leaders burn out and progress resets.</p>

      <h2>The tenure pattern</h2>
      <p>Many data leaders inherit fragmented systems, inconsistent definitions and a board expecting visible transformation within two quarters.</p>
      <p>Visible artefacts can be delivered quickly.</p>
      <p>Foundations cannot.</p>
      <p>Governance, metric alignment, lineage, access models and cultural norms move at a different speed.</p>
      <p>When transformation does not arrive as fast as hoped, organisations often change the individual rather than the horizon.</p>
      <p>Another restart follows.</p>
      <p>Compounding never occurs.</p>
      <p>Enterprise adoption is a multi-year arc with quarterly proof points, not quarterly reinvention.</p>

      <h2>Role design shapes outcomes</h2>
      <p>Senior hiring briefs frequently contain contradictions.</p>
      <p>Strategic leader.<br>
      Deeply hands on.<br>
      Able to operate at board level and jump into tickets.</p>
      <p>This is rarely clarity. It is unresolved organisational tension.</p>

      <h2>Sponsorship is behaviour, not agreement</h2>
      <p>Data quality and AI adoption do not sit inside the data team.</p>
      <p>True sponsorship shows up in rituals.</p>
      <p>Cross-functional forums where definitions are approved.<br>
      Metrics are retired.<br>
      Blockers are removed.<br>
      Infrastructure is funded.</p>

      <h2>Quick wins and silent costs</h2>
      <p>Under pressure, teams default to speed.</p>
      <p>A new dashboard.<br>
      A rapid automation.<br>
      Another platform purchase.</p>
      <p>Adoption includes subtraction.</p>

      <h2>AI introduces a new layer of ambiguity</h2>
      <p>Interest in AI has accelerated experimentation.</p>
      <p>Guardrails are more durable than bans.</p>

      <h2>Beyond dashboards</h2>
      <p>Stakeholders often want decisions, not charts.</p>
      <p>Consumption matters more than creation.</p>

      <h2>Capacity creation requires intent</h2>
      <p>Productivity gains create surplus capacity.</p>
      <p>Adoption is not only technical change. It is workforce design.</p>

      <h2>Patterns across the first 90 days</h2>
      <p><strong>Days 0–30</strong><br>
      Align ambition. Select one owned workflow. Publish guardrails. Define metrics.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 31–60</strong><br>
      Design the workflow. Pilot with real users. Iterate visibly.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 61–90</strong><br>
      Ship to production. Measure impact. Retire what was replaced.</p>

      <h2>What stable adoption looks like</h2>
      <p>Executives attend adoption forums.<br>
      Certified metrics are trusted.<br>
      Legacy processes are retired.</p>

      <p>None of this is theatrical.</p>
      <p>All of it compounds.</p>

      <p>The largest unlock is rarely a model choice.</p>
      <p>It is the decision to build stewardship first.</p>
