          <a href="https://www.humanlayerai.co.uk/articles/what-ai-adoption-really-means.html">Article 1, What AI adoption really means</a>
          <div class="meta">Definition first, so you stop mistaking pilots for progress.</div>
          <p class="desc">
            Using AI is easy.
            Adoption is when the workflow changes and outcomes improve.
            This piece sets the baseline so teams can measure what is actually changing.

          <a href="https://www.humanlayerai.co.uk/articles/guardrails-before-fireworks.html">Article 2, Guardrails before fireworks</a>
          <div class="meta">Speed comes from clarity, not chaos.</div>
          <p class="desc">
            The teams who move fastest define the rules early.
            Approved tools, clear boundaries, and a human check at the end.
            Guardrails reduce risk and increase adoption at the same time.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <a href="https://www.humanlayerai.co.uk/articles/bookend-skills.html">Article 3, Bookend skills</a>
          <div class="meta">Upstream intent, downstream judgement.</div>
          <p class="desc">
            Upstream, teams need problem framing and a clear definition of “good”.
            Downstream, they need validation, narrative, and a decision.
            This is the skill set that makes AI useful inside real workflows.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">

          <div class="meta">Do not refill the queue, build something reusable.</div>
          <p class="desc">
            The trap is filling freed time with more tickets.
            The opportunity is turning recurring asks into products, standards, and guided answers.
            This is what mature teams do when the backlog finally loosens.

      <h2>What this series is really about</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        AI changes the cost of work.
        It also changes the risk profile.
        The human layer is how you keep both under control.
        Clear intent at the start, and a human decision at the end.
