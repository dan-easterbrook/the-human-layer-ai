            The teams who move fastest are rarely the ones who ship the flashiest demo first.
            They define the rules, set expectations, and keep a human check at the end.

            Upstream, you need clarity on the question and what “good” looks like.
            Downstream, you need validation, narrative, and a real decision.
            This is the practical skill set most teams forget to train.

      <h2>What this series is really about</h2>
      <p>
        AI changes the cost of work.
        It also changes the risk profile.
      </p>
      <p>

        Clear intent at the start, and a human decision at the end.
