      <h1>Vendor Reality Checks</h1>
      <div class="meta">6–7 min read • AI Adoption</div>

      <p>
        Most organisations do not fail at AI because the technology is weak.
      </p>

      <p>
        They fail because they mistake motion for progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        A polished demo, a confident vendor, a roadmap full of promise. It all looks like momentum.
      </p>

      <p>
        But very little of it survives first contact with real work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The practical question is not whether the tool is impressive.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is whether it changes a workflow safely, with clear ownership and repeatable outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are building the foundations first, start with
        <a href="/articles/how-to-start-using-ai-in-your-business.html">How to Start Using AI in Your Business</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where AI Theatre Actually Starts</h2>

      <p>
        AI theatre thrives where the difference between capability and presentation is hard to see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not because people are naive, but because the space is moving quickly and vendors are incentivised to stay high level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, a pattern emerges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same questions come up after pilots stall, usage drops, or teams quietly revert to old ways of working.
      </p>

      <p>
        What exactly is this system replacing.
        Who owns the outputs.
        What happens when it is wrong.
        Where does human judgement sit now.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are not technical questions. They are operational ones.
      </p>

      <h2>The Vendor Conversation Is Usually Backwards</h2>

      <p>
        Most vendor conversations do not start with operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        They start with features, scale, model size, and benchmarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The assumption is that adoption will follow once the tool exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, it rarely does.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real adoption starts earlier, with constraint rather than possibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        What decisions does this system meaningfully change.
        Which parts of the workflow does it touch, and which does it deliberately leave alone.
        What does good usage look like on a bad day, not a perfect one.
      </p>

      <h2>What Strong Vendors Can Do That Weak Ones Cannot</h2>

      <p>
        Strong vendors can answer operational questions clearly, without deflection.
      </p>

      <p>
        They are specific about limits.
      </p>

      <p>
        They talk openly about where the system struggles.
      </p>

      <p>
        They understand the difference between automation and delegation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weaker ones stay high level.
      </p>

      <p>
        They rely on generalities and push responsibility for outcomes downstream to the customer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it fails, the implication is that adoption was mishandled.
      </p>

      <h2>Reality Checks That Protect Your Teams</h2>

      <p>
        Reality checks matter, not as a procurement exercise, but as a way of protecting teams from confusion later on.
      </p>

      <p>
        A useful test is to remove the AI language entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you describe the system without using words like intelligent, autonomous, or agentic, does the value still hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another is to ask how success is measured six months in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not usage metrics or engagement dashboards, but actual changes in decision quality, speed, or confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        What would people do differently if this system disappeared tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the answer is vague, adoption will be too.
      </p>

      <h2>Governance Is Part of Vendor Evaluation</h2>

      <p>
        Governance shows up in how you buy, not just how you build.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask what is logged, how long logs are retained, and whether you can access them easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask how prompts and data are separated across tenants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask what breaks internally if the system is paused.
      </p>

      <p>
        These questions are not traps. They are checks for production readiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want the broader structure behind these checks, see
        <a href="/articles/ai-governance-in-business.html">AI Governance in Business</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>What “Good” Looks Like in Practice</h2>

      <p>
        The most effective AI deployments tend to be quiet.
      </p>

      <p>
        They do not announce themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        They slot into existing decision points and reduce friction rather than creating new surfaces to manage.
      </p>

      <p>
        They respect the human layer.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI does not remove judgement. It reshapes where judgement is applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        When this is ignored, trust erodes quickly.
      </p>

      <p>
        People either over rely on outputs or ignore them entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neither leads to value.
      </p>

      <h2>The Calm Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        The organisations making steady progress tend to take a slower, more grounded approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        They choose tools that fit the shape of their work rather than forcing work to fit the tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        They invest in clarity before capability.
      </p>

      <p>
        They ask uncomfortable questions early, when the cost of change is still low.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cutting through AI theatre is less about scepticism and more about discipline.
      </p>

      <p>
        The technology will keep improving regardless.
      </p>

      <p>
        The differentiator is whether organisations build the conditions for it to be used well.
      </p>

      <p>
        That work is quieter, harder to market, and far more human than most AI narratives suggest.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>How should a business evaluate an AI vendor?</h3>
      <p>
        Start with the workflow, not the features. Ask what the system replaces, who owns the outputs, how errors are handled, and what changes in decision-making. Then test whether governance, logging, and support are production ready.
      </p>

      <h3>What questions reveal whether an AI tool is production ready?</h3>
      <p>
        Ask what is logged, how long logs are retained, how prompts and data are isolated across tenants, what monitoring exists, and what happens if the system must be paused. Production readiness is mostly operational.
      </p>

      <h3>What is AI theatre in vendor conversations?</h3>
      <p>
        AI theatre is when narrative outpaces operational reality. It often shows up as impressive demos without clear ownership, integration, auditability, or a plan for failure modes and human sign-off.
      </p>

      <h3>What should leaders measure after buying an AI tool?</h3>
      <p>
        Measure workflow outcomes such as cycle time, quality, error rates, decision confidence, and operational load. Usage dashboards can be useful, but they rarely reflect business impact on their own.
