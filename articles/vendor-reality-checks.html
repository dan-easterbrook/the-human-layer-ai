      <h1>Vendor reality checks</h1>
      <div class="meta">6–7 min read • Work and skills</div>

      <p>Most organisations do not fail at AI because the technology is weak.</p>

<p>They fail because they mistake motion for progress.</p>

<p>A polished demo, a confident vendor, a roadmap full of promise. It all looks like momentum. But very little of it survives first contact with real work.</p>

<h2>Where AI theatre actually starts</h2>

<p>This is where AI theatre thrives.</p>

<p>Not because people are naive, but because it is genuinely hard to tell the difference between capability and presentation when the space is moving this fast.</p>

<p>Over time, a pattern emerges.</p>

<p>The same questions come up after pilots stall, usage drops, or teams quietly revert to old ways of working.</p>

<p>What exactly is this system replacing?<br>
Who owns the outputs?<br>
What happens when it is wrong?<br>
Where does human judgement sit now?</p>

<p>These are not technical questions. They are operational ones.</p>

<h2>The vendor conversation is usually backwards</h2>

<p>Most vendor conversations do not start there.</p>

<p>They start with features, scale, model size, benchmarks. All impressive, all largely abstract. The assumption is that adoption will follow once the tool exists.</p>

<p>In practice, it rarely does.</p>

<p>Real adoption starts much earlier, with constraint rather than possibility.</p>

<p>What decisions does this system meaningfully change?<br>
Which parts of the workflow does it touch, and which does it deliberately leave alone?<br>
What does good usage look like on a bad day, not a perfect one?</p>

<h2>What strong vendors can do that weak ones cannot</h2>

<p>Strong vendors can answer these questions clearly, without deflection.</p>

<p>They are specific about limits. They talk openly about where the system struggles. They understand the difference between automation and delegation.</p>

<p>Weaker ones stay high level.</p>

<p>They rely on generalities like empowerment or transformation and push responsibility for outcomes downstream to the customer. If it fails, the implication is that adoption was mishandled.</p>

<h2>Reality checks that protect your teams</h2>

<p>This is why reality checks matter.</p>

<p>Not as a procurement exercise, but as a way of protecting teams from confusion later on.</p>

<p>A useful check is to remove the AI language entirely.</p>

<p>If you describe the system without using words like intelligent, autonomous, or agentic, does the value still hold?</p>

<p>Another is to ask how success is measured six months in.</p>

<p>Not usage metrics or engagement dashboards, but actual changes in decision quality, speed, or confidence. What would people do differently if this system disappeared tomorrow?</p>

<p>If the answer is vague, adoption will be too.</p>

<h2>What “good” looks like in practice</h2>

<p>The most effective AI deployments tend to be quiet.</p>

<p>They do not announce themselves. They do not rebrand workflows unnecessarily. They slot into existing decision points and reduce friction rather than creating new surfaces to manage.</p>

<p>They respect the human layer.</p>

<p>This is the part that rarely appears in vendor decks.</p>

<p>AI does not remove judgement. It reshapes where judgement is applied. When this is ignored, trust erodes quickly. People either over rely on outputs or ignore them entirely.</p>

<p>Neither leads to value.</p>

<h2>The calm conclusion</h2>

<p>The organisations making steady progress tend to take a slower, more grounded approach.</p>

<p>They choose tools that fit the shape of their work rather than forcing work to fit the tool. They invest in clarity before capability. They ask uncomfortable questions early, when the cost of change is still low.</p>

<p>Cutting through AI theatre is less about scepticism and more about discipline.</p>

<p>The technology will keep improving regardless.</p>

<p>The differentiator is whether organisations build the conditions for it to be used well.</p>

<p>That work is quieter, harder to market, and far more human than most AI narratives suggest.</p>

<p>And it is where the real advantage tends to sit.</p>
